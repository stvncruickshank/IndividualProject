/**
 * STEVEN CRUICKSHANK
 * PROJECT THREE - SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT
 *
 * On the professors suggestion, i took the existing reservation app, and loaded it with new features
 * and a fresh new UI.
 *
 * All of the requirements are met:
 * -SQLite Database ~ Date, Time, Name, Phone, and Location are written to a SQLite database
 *
 * -Location Services ~ When a user makes a reservation, location services takes note of the users
 * last location, and lists those coordinates in the DB. knowing where your reservations are coming
 * from is a fantastic way to target specific areas with advertising.
 *
 * -Audio/Video ~ jazzy piano and background noises (clanking, light chatting) play while the user makes
 * their reservation. At the very top is a looping video of a nameless couple enjoying a meal.
 *
 * -Multiple Fragments/Activites
 *
 * -Splash Screen - a blue color will pop up while the App loads. For some reason I was having trouble
 * projecting the icon on top of that lbue screen.
 *
 * -Ability to communicate - send the reservation to the phone number, or go to an ACTION DIAL
 * prompt, via intents
 *
 * -UI that works in landscape - Designed a landscape layout for the UI that looks very nice.
 * All data is preserved on rotation. There is a slight problem with the audio, in that if you
 * rotate and attempt to stop/play, new audioclips will start to play over the existing.
